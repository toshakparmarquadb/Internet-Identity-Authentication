# `icp_auth (Internet definity Authentication)` 

Welcome to your new `icp_auth` project and to the Internet Computer development community. By default, creating a new project adds this README and some template files to your project directory. You can edit these template files to customize your project and to include your own code to speed up the development cycle.

To get started, you might want to explore the project directory structure and the default configuration file. Working with this project in your development environment will not affect any production deployment or identity tokens.

To learn more before you start working with `icp_auth`, see the following documentation available online:

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

## Now Continue See and working with this Repo using theses steps:

### 1. Clone This Repo:
```bash
  # Clone the git repo
  git init
  git clone <git repo link>

  # Open the Code in Code Editor VS Code.
  code .
```

### 2. Install Dependencies run following commands: 
```bash
  # Install Dependencies in Frontend:
  cd src/icp_auth_frontend
  npm install

  # Back to Root Directory and go to project directory
  cd ~
  cd <directory_name>
```

### 3. Deploy the Backend and Frontend:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```
Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

### 4. Genrate & Run the Frontend Code.

```bash
npm run generate
```

at any time. This is recommended before starting the frontend development server, and will be run automatically any time you run `dfx deploy`.

If you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
   # Run the Frontend Code..
   cd src/icp_auth_frontend
   npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations
  - Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor
